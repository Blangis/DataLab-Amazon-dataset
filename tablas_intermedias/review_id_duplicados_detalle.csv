Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are ""un-installable"". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the ""Alert slider"" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in ""Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.👍,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don't buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it's working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it's ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.","17,415",4.3,"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)"

The technician brought a cheap hanging hook that had MRP INR116 on it and asked for INR499 for it without any receipt. He kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. However, it clearly had MRP mentioned on it2. I went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just INR200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. He just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws ( which I had bought ) with him. After about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. And for all this, he kept cussing me that I wasted his time. There was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.This whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. This was the worst installation experience in my life so far.Bottomline - Please do not avail the 'so called free' installation service from Amazon. It is just a scam. Instead call the acer support. They will do the job much better.,After using it for 2 months, here are it's pros and cons:Pros :1. Great picture quality. It's awesome.2. Blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. Sound with 30db is very good4. Looks great with thin besel5. Remote comes with favorite OTT buttons.6. Content upscaling is very good.Cons:1. Remote could have been better. Can't use DTH remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. Remote operation is bit complex.3. Motion technology not great. There is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson OTT, but it decreases when you switch to DTH.Overall, it's a nice buy at this price point. I think I am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. I am satisfied with the product.,Product has good picture quality. Good product at that price with 25w sound. Applications running smoothly. 3 months older & no issues yet. It's running smoothly.,You get decent features for the price you pay. Screen resolution might be. Set back as you may find pixalation. Overall it's good,I am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p (HD Ready) TV. It is truly an amazing panel. I found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. Any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. The speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. However, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the TV is wall mounted or kept on a stand.The remote is good, voice search works well for me. TV start up takes a long time in my opinion, but I have not compared it against any other 32 inch TV and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 GHz Wifi works very well even across walls. Only negative aspect I faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphones/earphones. Firstly, the connection sometimes doesn't happen automatically after a  restart - which means I have to remove and re-discover the device thru the menu which is not simple. Secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the TV, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 2-3 inches.However, I am still super happy with this TV. I got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,At this price range(₹11499/-)it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with Sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.Picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is good(sometimes lagging).No major issues found on this TV.Just go for it.,Vellu for money.

But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone 😤,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not","I was looking for a phone below 10K. I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don't watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don't need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don't have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can't especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don't like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don't know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... ""NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING""NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- camera😤😤,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, I've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. But I don't have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine","50,772",4.1,"Redmi Note 11 (Space Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)|90Hz FHD+ AMOLED Display | Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 680-6nm | 33W Charger Included"

But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don't have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can't especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don't like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don't know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... ""NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING""NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- camera😤😤,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, I've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. But I don't have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine","50,772",4.1,"Redmi Note 11 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) | 90Hz FHD+ AMOLED Display | Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 680-6nm | 33W Charger Included"

But afraid of future MIUI updates.,Don't purchase it as camera phone 😤,Dependable & it's been a year.,Budget mobile,Good for basic use,Phone is nice , but software is not","I was looking for a phone below 10K. I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don't watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don't need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top.

When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation.

Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2.

Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn’t an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn’t bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. It’s not the thickest I’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. Given my application it’s more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing.

Value for money.,Value for money,Improvements Needed,Everything thing good except the installation experience,Overall taking all aspects TV is good within the price point,Tv installation services,One among the good TVs in the market.,Picture","I am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.Usage: Continuous, OTT only, no Cable/Dish operator.Average daily usage: 6-8 hours.The TV is a great value-for-money product.Installation: The installation was simple and Amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hassle-free.Picture: The picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a Sony, LG and Samsung with these kind of specs. Movies and especially hi-res TV series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hi-res , wouldn't look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of Sony, Samsung LG etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone else's better TV.Sound: Sound output is decent. You wouldn't need additional support to enhance the volume as such.Remote: Sleek, sensitive and user-friendly. It's exactly like Amazon's remote.OS: Same as any smart Android TV. Works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. Switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than Sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.Standalone and as your first smart TV,  you wouldn't find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hi-res from the beginning. It is a great value for money product without a doubt.However, if you are considering this as an alternative or second TV after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,Picture quality is good for this price, didn’t faced any lag on UI and browsing other apps. Only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. Overall worth for money u spend. But the installation process is just awful, Amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. No demo given on Tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,Screen looks amazing but problem is with processor I believe. If 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickers(not so often but problem exists), even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.Reason why I believe processor is bad because I do 4k gaming using PS5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,If you buy TV in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. When you want to buy a TV from Amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. The problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. It’s like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you can’t eat. So I ordered my TV on Monday, it got delivered on Friday and it will be installed on Monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. If we had the technician details, we could reach out  s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.Regarding product, it’s good quality and very good for a average user. Heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, I guess.,This TV gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1) The installation guy didn’t arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didn’t came for installation purpose. So strictly be aware of this point.2) The TV I got in offer with 3k discount on ICICI card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3) Even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece I didn’t got the replacement for the product and it’s totally unfair deal by Amazon and the seller too.Final verdict is the TV quality and feature are good but the service from seller and Amazon that is got was very poor inspite I was prime member. The seller DAWNTECH ELECTRONICS PRIVATE LIMITED gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases Amazon will not help you. Thankyou,Team,Also to be added TV installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. NO need to other sub-vendor to getting installation and demo. Also dependency on third-party involvement should be less.Bad experience with TV installation stuff.Pls look into this .,Picture quality good. Sound quality  not upto my 3xpectations.

But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating.

The TV is still going strong - all the good points mentioned in the original review below are still true and very happy with the TV.It's as if OnePlus have been listening to their customers! After recent firmware updates, the issues I had mentioned have almost disappeared.1. We can now arrange and move apps (YouTube, Netflix) as per our wish on the home screen itself. I am finally able to put YouTube first as it is the most used app for my toddler.2. There is no more wifi disconnect issue noted earlier.3. Prime Video still shows errors sometimes. Though I think that's an issue with the app and not the TV.Strongly recommend this TV!Original Review:I took a leap of faith in purchasing this TV as there were mixed reviews for it. However, after using it for 2 months, the following are my observations:Good:1. The picture quality is fantastic. There is no lag while watching/forwarding 4k/8k videos.2. I saw a youtube review which said its brightness was low compared to other models - The brightness is more than you would ever need from a TV. I have never needed to run it on full brightness till now, up to 40 works for me. For my toddler to watch rhymes, I set brightness to 0, and even then it is more than needed.3. There were a few reviews that said the sound quality was average and you need a soundbar. I disagree - I have watched movies with up to 50 sound and that is good enough for a 1000 sqft hall.4. Voice command - it is quite accurate and I am able to change nursery rhymes for my toddler while working in the kitchen which is around 15 - 20 feet away.5. Being able to control the TV from app is also a very useful feature - no need to look for remote. Being able to cast from the app also helps a lot. It would be even better if everything on phone (not just pictures and videos) could be cast using the appNot so good:1. If the TV goes to sleep/screensaver for more than 10 minutes,a. it often gets disconnected from wifi - have to restart it againb. prime video fails to resume - displays error - and have to restart the TV againc. On the home screen, you cannot rearrange apps to have your preferred apps first. You can do it in apps window which is useless as you need to navigate to it first - easier to navigate to your preferred app in the home screen itself.,Only Cons till now got, fast moving object looks blurr, which was known before buying by other user review, but i got this tv in 32 k,Ao over all satishfied,Only minus that too critical is the installation service provider.The product is to installed by v care installation services provider.The installation service provider is a total waste and not responded properly.Actual date of installation was on 21.02.22 but was only done by the service provider on 27.10.22.The executive who attended the installation is a total waste person and don't know how to behave to the customer.He behaved very rudely.The installation service provider is a total damage and waste.

The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,🔥 Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen 📱 issues some times it's too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it's very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.🔥 15 मिनट में उपयोग के दौरान हीटिंग की समस्या।टच स्क्रीन 📱 कभी-कभी जारी करती है यह बहुत बढ़िया है और कभी-कभी आपको टाइप करते समय सैमसंग कुंजी पैड पर भी कई बार स्पर्श करना पड़ता है।हम सभी परिवार सैमसंग मोबाइल का उपयोग कर रहे हैं लेकिन इस बार मैं मुद्दों से चिंतित हूं अगर मुझे समान मुद्दों का सामना करना पड़ता है तो मुझे मोबाइल बदलना होगा और डेटा ट्रांसफर करना होगा यह बहुत परेशान करने वाला काम है अगर कोई सैमसंग इस समीक्षा को पढ़ रहा है तो कृपया मुझे अमेज़ॅन के माध्यम से उत्तर दें .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls.

Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard-disk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs (two numbers) and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. It’s compatible with all. It’s plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I’m working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it’s not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would’ve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn’t make these strange design decisions.

Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard-disk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs (two numbers) and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. It’s compatible with all. It’s plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I’m working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it’s not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would’ve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn’t make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps.

Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent.

"R36UIGIQWYOKT,RISUCL5YV9EZN",B09TWH8YHM,"THE PERFECT PHONE – FOR MY REQUIREMENTS,Galaxy M33 5G a mixed bag of Affordability","I would not consider buying an i-phone simply because my friend owns two of them – or blindly go for a new Android model suggested by my son or nephew (both of whom are more tech savvy than me) because their recommendations are obviously based on their own needs and expectations, which may differ from mine. I am an old-fashioned mechanical engineer with a basic understanding of parameters like millimetres, megapixels and megabytes – but I think of a cellphone as a utility item, not a status symbol. Applying a technocratic approach, I would not choose a costlier option unless I get additional features which suit my requirements.My foremost requirement – which is entirely non-negotiable – is that my handset must have provision for two SIM cards, since I do not want to carry two separate handsets for my CUG and personal numbers. My other requirements are not difficult to fulfil: a phonebook with at least 2000 contacts, basic net connectivity, a basic camera for photos and videos and scope for downloading a few apps such as the ubiquitous WhatsApp and my favourite word games (which do not need much memory or processing capacity). I would certainly appreciate practical features like high reliability, software and security updates and high battery capacity (sufficient for 24 hours or preferably 48 hours at my normal level of usage). Besides, I would like to use a new handset for at least two years.Apart from exigencies, I do not intend to use my cellphone for surfing the Internet, videoconferencing or sending e-mails as I prefer using a desktop or laptop for such activities.I am equally clear about what I do not need. I do not intend to use my cellphone for watching movies, reading books, listening to music or creating fancy social media posts. Nor do I want a device for taking high resolution photos during a vacation as I would prefer to use a camera. At the risk of sounding flippant, I would say that I do not want a device to unlock my car or count the strokes in a game of golf – primarily because I do not own a car and I do not play golf!Having used smartphones of Samsung and Motorola makes over the past few years, I vastly prefer the former. My last phone, which gave me over 30 months of good service, was a Samsung M30. Since that model is obsolete now, I focused on its upgraded cousins: M32, M33 and M52. The last was immediately ruled out as it does not support two SIM cards along with an SD card. After studying the relative specifications of M32 and M33, I concluded that the latter offers better value for money. Generally, it is worth going for the higher memory and higher RAM versions as these parameters affect the performance and the difference in cost is relatively small. With these considerations, I narrowed down my choice to M33 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage (Just twenty years ago, I was using a desktop with 2GB memory!)As a confirmation for my choice, I compared the phone I had selected with OnePlus Nord CE 2 (8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) which my son had recommended. The specification of the Samsung phone was found to be equivalent or superior for the major parameters, except that the display screen technology was TFT instead of AMOLED. I also watched some Youtube videos about these handsets for a better appreciation of their competing features. The clinching factor was that the Samsung phone was priced substantially lower than the OnePlus product.As for body colour, my first choice was Emerald Brown, but I settled for the Mystique Green since the former was not available in my selected configuration. I was thinking this would be irrelevant since I use a case which completely encloses the handset, but it turned out that the body colour can be glimpsed through the cutout for the cameras on the rear of the phone.Despite a strong family resemblance with my old one (M30), the new phone (M33) offers decidedly superior specifications and it meets my requirements perfectly. It is a few millimetres longer and a few grams heavier than my old phone, but these differences are acceptable to me. Thanks to the 50MP front camera and 8MP selfie camera, the quality of photos and videos is above my expectations (see sample pic taken at night at a distance of about 30 metres from the stage).  This phone offers two years of android updates and four years of security patch updates, which reduces the worries on these fronts. Youtube reviewers complain that the M33 has plain looks, it is heavy, its audio does not offer an ‘immersive listening experience’ and its screen is plain old TFT instead of AMOLED. I am willing to live with these perceived shortcomings, so long as the M33 meets my requirements.I was glad to find that Samsung has taken an environmentally friendly step of offering many models of handsets without chargers – because old chargers, like old handsets, add to e-waste. However, it needs to be kept in mind that new handsets require higher capacity chargers. The recommended charger for M33 is 25 watts, but the chargers I had at home are rated at 5 or 10 watts.To cut a long story short, I ordered a 25-watt charger along with the phone to avoid compromising with the charging time. After using the new handset for a couple of weeks, I find that my phone is at 60-70% charge at the end of the day, and it takes 30-40 minutes for complete charging (one of the useful features of M33 is that it shows the time remaining for complete charging as soon as it is plugged in for charging). It turns out that I could have managed with the old 10-watt charger, except that it would have taken 60-90 minutes for full charging.I conclude by emphasizing that Samsung Galaxy M33 5g is the perfect phone – but for my requirements.

Samsung is always good,Value for money product","Before finalizing the AUE60 55"", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55"" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I'll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision.

I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. It's a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I'd highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.,,Placed order on 18th Dec'22 received Defective product, updated to Amazon service they replaced with new product today(27/12/22).will post long term review.Pros: Picture Quality, Design (thin n Bezel less)Cons: Sound (bit okay),upsacling of SD channelsOver all Satisfied.,Have been using it since month now.-Picture quality is amazing. 4.5/5-As always installation service from Samsung was seemless. 5/5-smart features are good this model don't have voice recognition. I don't require it so its fine. 4/5-Audio quality is not good. It's clear but loudness is not sufficient if installing in big hall. It also lacks base.Purchase a sound bar separately if buying this model.,But the picture quality is ok-ok.,Best tv product in given price range,Value for money. Samsung is always good,Value for money product","7,109",4.3,Samsung 138 cm (55 inches) Crystal 4K Neo Series Ultra HD Smart LED TV UA55AUE65AKXXL (Black)

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. 👍🏻,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it's super product and 3 year's of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one.

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days.
