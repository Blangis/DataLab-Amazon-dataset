Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don't buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I'm not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man's review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,My boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV, Laptop and my phone.

They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakas😜Sound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h🤩🤩, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhi😂😂I think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai😂😂 enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv",B01FSYQ2A4,4.1,"97,174"

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakas😜Sound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h🤩🤩, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhi😂😂I think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai😂😂 enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv",B01FSYQ2A4,4.1,"97,175"

The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,👍,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,It's little expensive but okkk,",B096VF5YYF,4.1,"48,448"

There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,👍,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,It's little expensive but okkk,",B096VF5YYF,4.1,"48,449"

Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super 👍. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",B0B3RRWSF6,4.3,"27,709"

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super 👍. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look",B0B3RRWSF6,4.3,"27,696"
